# Space-SLEAP
A repo for scripts associated with the Space SLEAP project, which points SLEAP to videos of freely behaving mice aboard the International Space Station.

Here we include:
- Standardize Archived Videos.py for standardizing video resolution by a common centerpoint
- Undistort SLEAP Labels.py for translating SLEAP labels across video correction phases
- interannotator_labelling_consistency.py for assessing labelling consistency among human annotators
- Space SLEAP Model Evaluation.py for assessing model performance relative to human error


To run scripts associated with this project, one must request the video dataset and .slp files from NASA's Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), project [OSD-952](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-952), doi.org/10.26030/6m3b-gd71
