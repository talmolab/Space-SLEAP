# Space-SLEAP
A repo for scripts associated with the Space SLEAP project, which points SLEAP to videos of freely behaving mice aboard the International Space Station.

To run scripts associated with this project, one must request the video dataset and .slp files from NASA's Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), project [OSD-952](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/studies/OSD-952), doi.org/10.26030/6m3b-gd71

Here we include:
interannotator_labelling_consistency.py for assessing labelling consistency among human annotators
